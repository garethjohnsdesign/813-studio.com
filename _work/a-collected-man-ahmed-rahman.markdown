As part of an ongoing series of interviews for vintage watch retailer, A Collected Man, we photographed and interviewed Ahmed Rahman, a gentlemanly watch collector from Bangladesh. Ahmed has become known among the watch collecting community for his unique style and his very special collection of watches. This piece of content, called 'about town,' was designed to have collectors show readers how they experience various cities around the world. This piece of content sits within a larger editorial strategy which we devised and implemented for A Collected Man, to develop their corporate personality and attract new business.
