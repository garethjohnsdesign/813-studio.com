As part of an ongoing series of interviews for vintage watch retailer, A Collected Man, we photographed and interviewed Mo Coppoletta, a gentlemanly tattoo artist from Italy. Mo has become widely known for his tattoo work, having collaborated with various watch brands as well as Rolls Royce. We sat down with Mo in his London based tattoo shop to discuss his artwork, watches and the watch industry as a whole. This piece of content sits within a larger editorial strategy which we devised and implemented for A Collected Man, to develop their corporate personality and attract new business.
