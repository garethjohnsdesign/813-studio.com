As part of an ongoing series of interviews for vintage watch retailer, A Collected Man, we photographed and interviewed Philippe Dufour, an independent watchmaker who is widely considered to make the finest watches in the world. This piece of content sits within a larger editorial strategy which we devised and implemented for A Collected Man, to develop their corporate personality and attract new business.
