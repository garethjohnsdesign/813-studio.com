As part of an ongoing series of interviews for vintage watch retailer, A Collected Man, we photographed and interviewed Kristian Haagen, a horological photographer and personality in his own right. Kristian became known for having numerous books published on the subject, in addition to writing for numerous publications. This piece of content, called ‘about town,’ was designed to have collectors show readers how they experience various cities around the world. This piece of content sits within a larger editorial strategy which we devised and implemented for A Collected Man, to develop their corporate personality and attract new business.
