As part of an ongoing series of interviews for vintage watch retailer, A Collected Man, we photographed and interviewed Aurel Bacs, a world famous watch auctioneer. Aurel has become widely known for having sold some of the most expensive watches in the world, including Paul Newman's own vintage Rolex Daytona. This watch broke the world record for the most expensive wristwatch ever auctioned, pulling in $17.8M. We flew to Geneva, Switzerland to photograph and interview Aurel in the lead up to this achievement. This piece of content sits within a larger editorial strategy which we devised and implemented for A Collected Man, to develop their corporate personality and attract new business.
