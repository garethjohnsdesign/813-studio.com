As part of an ongoing series of interviews for vintage watch retailer, A Collected Man, we photographed and interviewed Jasper Eckert, a vintage Porsche collector & restorer from Hamburg, Germany. Jasper and his family owned company, Fine Eleven, restore and make custom back-dated Porsche 911's. We flew out to Hamburg to see the one car he owns that he could never let go of. This piece of content sits within a larger editorial strategy which we devised and implemented for A Collected Man, to develop their corporate personality and attract new business.
