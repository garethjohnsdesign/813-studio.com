Stephen Bayley is a very highly regarded author, critic, columnist, broadcaster, consultant, debater and curator. Perhaps his most influential achievement was the opening of the Boilerhouse Project with Terence Conran in the basement of the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. This gallery put to use an unused area of the building and would highlight artists, architects and designers to such success, that the suggestion of opening its own premises was quickly suggested. This new institution would be the Design Museum, which has hosted exhibitions for Porsche, Alpha Romeo and Eames to name but a few. We decided to catch up with Stephen over some coffee and watches.
