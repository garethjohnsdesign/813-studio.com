Episode one of an ongoing video series for A Collected Man, a vintage watch retailer for whom we built an editorial strategy for. This film was produced to focus on the subject of time spent, rather than typical product focussed editorial in the watch industry. This episode features Stephen Bayley, co-founder of the London Design Museum, describing his morning routine.
