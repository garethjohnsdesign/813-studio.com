Episode two of a five part video series for Omega watches, celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Seamaster wristwatch.  We produced, directed and edited the series, which was distributed online via A Collected Man. This episode features Craig Muir, a commercial saturation diver and watch collector, residing on the remote Orkney islands, north of Scotland.
