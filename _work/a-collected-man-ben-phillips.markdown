As part of an ongoing series of interviews for vintage watch retailer, A Collected Man, we photographed and interviewed Ben Phillips of Drake's London. Ben has become known for his unique gentlemanly dress sense and as a collector of vintage Omega watches, we sat down with him to discuss the one watch he would never sell. This piece of content sits within a larger editorial strategy which we devised and implemented for A Collected Man, to develop their corporate personality and attract new business.
