  text: We currently have no permanent full-time positions available, but we do regularly
    use freelances and run paid internships at our studio. A typical internship would
    run for a three-month period, enabling valuable, hands-on experience in a friendly,
    busy studio contributing directly to client projects. We are always interested
    in hearing from talented people so, if you feel that you fit the brief, send a
    CV and some examples of your work (no PDFs over 5MB) to [enquiries@813-studio.com](mailto:enquiries@813-studio.com)
    and let us know what role you’re interested in.
